// any widget that uses scaffold in its function is either a screen or page,because scaffold is used whenever we need appbar and body to be used .
// GridView --> it is same as listview but difference is that in gridview if we want our element side-by-side that is not possible in listview thats why we use gridview 
// GestureDetector--> is used to add the listeners whenever user taps on the element .
// InkWell --> same as gesture detector but it highlights when we tap on the element .
// ClipRRect --> it is a type of widget in which we can fold / use any other widget as a child and force or change its property.
// Positioned --> is used to position the child widget in its actually coordinate space.
// onGenerateRoute --> is used to generate a route whenever a route is not mentioned in our app i.e. we have not generated in the route settings of it. & using it we can generate the route by passing the route settings .
// onUnkownRoute --> is used whenever our app does not have any specific route to generate i.e. same as 404 Error (it does not exist/ been removed)
// DefaultTabController --> it is used to add default tabs in the screen eg. whatsapp which has 3 tabs next to each other like chats tab,status tab and calls tab , in this length is to how many tabs we will be having in or app and child consist of our other widgets like Scaffold to have entire screen.
// BottomNavigationBarItem -->it is used to navigation bar at the bottom of the screen it is not same as defaulttabcontroller
// pushreplacementnamed --> is used to replace the navigator which was there instead of filling up the stack which is happening in push() / pushNamed() .
