// any widget that uses scaffold in its function is either a screen or page,because scaffold is used whenever we need appbar and body to be used .
// GridView --> it is same as listview but difference is that in gridview if we want our element side-by-side that is not possible in listview thats why we use gridview 
// GestureDetector--> is used to add the listeners whenever user taps on the element .
// InkWell --> same as gesture detector but it highlights when we tap on the element .
